# Small Talks App
## Idea
The idea of the project is to introduce all employees 
of the company to each other and get a warmer atmosphere
in the team.

## How it works?
Every 2 **working**(9:00-18:00) hours *small talks app* collects members of your *space*
who has been subscribed to meetings. Creates a meeting with 
random not formal topic for all of them for 15 minutes. That's all for now.

## Get started

2. It will ask rights it needed. Administrator of your *space* will get the notification and approve it.
